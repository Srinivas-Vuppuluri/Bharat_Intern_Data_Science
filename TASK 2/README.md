# Titanic-calssification
The Titanic dataset is a classic playground for data scientists. It involves predicting passenger survival on the ill-fated ship based on various features. This task falls under the umbrella of classification in data science, where we aim to assign each passenger to one of two classes: survived or did not survive.

Data scientists employ a variety of machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, logistic regression, and support vector machines to tackle this problem. They preprocess and clean the data, handle missing values, and engineer new features to improve model performance.

Once models are trained and validated, evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to measure their performance. The Titanic dataset serves as a great introduction to classification problems in data science and helps practitioners refine their skills while exploring the tragic history of the ship.
